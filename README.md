## APPLICATION PROJECT

This was the project we developed for our Hackathon, the final event of our programming bootcamp. In 24 hours we had to come up with the idea, execute it and present it to our fellow Code Cadets, Master Coders, IT company representatives and more.

## The Idea

We were given a theme and a song to extrapolate from. The theme was 'Solo Traveller' and the song was 'Should i stay or should i go' by 'The Clash'. We took the key concept of the song, which in our opinion focuses a lot on the idea of stay or go, and for this reason we decided to develop InABlink a travel app, for adventurous, impulsive and undecided people. 

InABlink is a website where we can book trips, with no worries about dates or accommodation, we only have to inserted some preferences, such as the type of tourism (cultural, rest or adventure), the type of environment (urban, beach or countryside), and of course, the budget. After filling in the preferences, 3 different destinations will be drawn to us, one at a time. We will have 30 seconds to decide whether we want to choose that destination or move on to the next. After 3 "stay's", we are not given any more options and we will only be able to raffle new ones for the next week. If we choose a destination, we will proceed to the payment part, and nowhere will we be informed of the place where we will be staying. We will only know the place, hours before the outward journey.

## The Development

Our group was made out of 5 awesome developers that had never met before. Through solid communication and teamwork we were able to branch our work in order to reach our MVP goals and even further. We managed to early on establish our branching according to our strengths which resulted in very clear paths for both back end and front end development. We started by exploring our options with mock-up design and UML schematics. We created a host using heroKu to respond to our data requests using a MySQL database. We also built a functional front end with the user experience in mind.
